# Sales Trend Analysis Using MySQL

## Project Overview

This project presents a sales trend analysis using SQL queries on an e-commerce dataset. The objective was to analyze monthly revenue and order volume by extracting and aggregating time-based data from the orders table. The focus was on understanding how sales and order behavior vary across different months and years.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project is derived from a retail superstore's transactional records, containing over 9,900 rows of order information. Key fields included order dates, sales amounts, and order identifiers, which were critical for this time-series aggregation.

## Tools & Technologies

- MySQL (Workbench)
- SQL Aggregation Functions

## Methodology

The analysis involved the following key steps:
- Extracting year and month from the order date
- Aggregating total revenue using SQL's `SUM()` function
- Calculating monthly order volume using `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)`
- Filtering the data for a specific time period (2016â€“2017)
- Ordering the results chronologically

## Output Screenshot

Below is the screenshot of the final query output showing monthly revenue and order volume:
